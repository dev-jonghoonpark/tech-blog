# Forcing Repeater Mode Activation on ASUS Routers

The method for enabling repeater mode is provided in the official FAQ:

[[Wireless Router] How to set up repeater mode?](https://www.asus.com/support/faq/1036082/)

Despite this, I decided to write this guide for a specific reason:

I am currently using the **ZenWiFi AX Mini**, and I discovered that this model does not allow users to select repeater mode in its configuration settings. While I, with a background in web development, could easily work around this, others might find it frustrating. Thus, I want to share a guide on how to force-enable this mode.

## Instructions

![no repeater mode in config](/assets/images/2025-06-25-asus-router-active-repeater-mode/no-repeater-mode-in-config.png)

As shown above, there’s no repeater mode in the configuration screen. However, there’s a workaround to use repeater mode.

![quick internet setup](/assets/images/2025-06-25-asus-router-active-repeater-mode/quick-internet-setup.png)

Click **Quick Internet Setup** from the left menu.

![quick internet setup main](/assets/images/2025-06-25-asus-router-active-repeater-mode/quick-internet-setup-main.png)

On the main page of Quick Internet Setup, click **Advanced Settings** at the bottom.

![select Choose operation mode](/assets/images/2025-06-25-asus-router-active-repeater-mode/select-choose-operation-mode.png)

Select **Choose operation mode**

![mode list](/assets/images/2025-06-25-asus-router-active-repeater-mode/mode-list.png)

A list of modes will appear, but **repeater mode** is not listed here. To bypass this, you’ll need to use the **Developer Tools**.

You can open Developer Tools using the following shortcuts:

| OS               | Shortcut                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Windows or Linux | `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`      |
| Mac              | `Fn + F12` or `Cmd + Option + I` |

Alternatively,
`Click the menu button in the top-right corner` → `More tools` → `Developer tools.`

![manual open devtools](/assets/images/2025-06-25-asus-router-active-repeater-mode/manual-open-devtools.png)

Once opened, go to the `Console` tab and enter the following command, then press Enter to execute:

```javascript
goTo.rpMode();
```

This will take you to the page for configuring repeater mode.

![enter to repeater mode page](/assets/images/2025-06-25-asus-router-active-repeater-mode/enter-to-repeater-mode-page.png)

Wait for a moment while the search completes, and nearby Wi-Fi networks will be displayed.

From here, you can proceed with the usual setup.

## Issue: Only 2.4G Appearing on Repeater Mode Configuration

After completing the setup, I noticed that only 2.4G networks were listed, with no 5G options available.

To resolve this, you can manually configure the 5G network.

You can perform manual setup by clicking the **Manual config** button under the wifi list on the Settings page.

Make sure to carefully type the **Network Name (SSID)** manually without any typos. Double-check the name for accuracy before proceeding.

## Conclusion

This guide explained how to bypass limitations and set up repeater mode on ASUS routers. After testing it for a day, I found it to work without any issues. I hope this guide proves helpful for anyone struggling with unstable internet connections.
