<p>
  I recently started an offline group study.<br />
  One of the things going on in the study is an operating system study (We are
  using
  <a href="https://www.os-book.com/OS10/" title="this book">this book</a>).
</p>
<p>
  At the end of Chapter 2, there is a section that describes the Linux kernel
  build.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  While I was making a presentation slide, I was like, 'Is this really going to
  work?' It occurred to me that.

<p>
  So I tried it.<br />
  <del>I shouldn't have tried that</del>
</p>
<h1>Try building the Linux kernel</h1>
<p>The order introduced in the book was as follows.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Download the Linux source code from
    <a href="http://www.kernel.org">http://www.kernel.org</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Configure the kernel using the “make menuconfig” command. This step creates
    a .config configuration file.
  </li>
  <li>
    Compile the main kernel using the “make” command. The make command compiles
    the kernel based on the configuration parameters identified in the .config
    file to create a kernel image, the vmlinuz file.
  </li>
  <li>
    Compile the kernel module using the “make modules” command. Like kernel
    compilation, module compilation depends on configuration parameters
    specified in the .config file.
  </li>
  <li>
    Install the kernel module to vmlinuz using the “make modules install”
    command.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enter the “make install” command to install the new kernel on your system.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>And I followed this order</p>
<h2>Caution</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Since the mac m1 is arm-based, I started with the expectation that it would
    be difficult in the process.
  </li>
  <li>
    I'm trying to organize it in writing to see if there is anyone who makes a
    unique attempt like me. In my own search, I didn't find much information.
  </li>
  <li>
    I'm not familiar with C. It's all I studied in my first year of university.
    That's why the following contents have been solved in a bad way.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
  1. Download the Linux source code from
  <a href="http://www.kernel.org" title="http://www.kernel.org"
    >http://www.kernel.org</a
  >.
</h2>
<p>

    alt="kernel downlaod page"
  />
</p>
<p>
  Latest Release seems to mean the Stable version.<br />
  Download and decompress it in a good place to work.
</p>
<h2>2. Configure the kernel using the “make menuconfig” command.</h2>
<p>There are things to do from here.</p>
<p>
  Since I usually use the <code>make</code> command during the development
  process, I thought there would be no problem, but the problem occurs with the
  <code>make</code> command.
</p>
<p>
  When I run it, I get the following error:<br />
  <code
    >Makefile:15: *** GNU Make &gt;= 3.82 is required. Your Make version is
    3.81. Stop</code
  >
</p>
<p>
  The latest version of make is available through brew. Let's set environment
  variables as well.
</p>
<pre><code>brew install make
export PATH=&quot;/usr/local/opt/make/libexec/gnubin:$PATH&quot;</code></pre>
<p>
  If you check the version after installing the latest version with brew, you
  can see that it has been upgraded to the 4.x version.<br />

    alt="make version"
  />
</p>
<p>Then install the following things</p>
<pre><code>brew install gcc-arm-embedded --cask
brew install cmake autoconf libtool gcc automake openssl
brew link openssl --force</code></pre>
<p>
  if you don't install<br />
  <img
    src="https://jonghoonpark.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1692545466662.png"
    alt="linker error"
  /><br />
  This error will occur.
</p>
<p>
  After completing the installation, you can finally enter the menu setting
  page.
</p>
<p>

    alt="menuconfig"
  />
</p>
<p>
  Since I don't know anything about these setting values, I created a config
  file with the default setting values.
</p>
<h2>3. Compile the main kernel using the “make” command.</h2>
<p>
  This process took quite a long time.<br />
  I think it was more difficult because I didn't know much about C.
</p>
<p>
  This part referenced a lot of blog post written down in the reference at the
  bottom.
</p>
<h3>fatal error: 'elf.h' file not found</h3>
<p>In mac, elf.h is not provided by default.</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://gist.github.com/mlafeldt/3885346"
    >https://gist.github.com/mlafeldt/3885346</a
  ><br />
  You can create elf.h with the above code.
</p>
<p>or,</p>
<pre><code>curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mlafeldt/3885346/raw/elf.h | tee /usr/local/include/elf.h</code></pre>
<p>If you type this command, it will be created at once.</p>
<p>
  But the problem was, I don't know why, but my code couldn't load the header
  file normally.<br />
  (Maybe it's because I don't know how to use gcc's I option properly.)
</p>
<p>
  So move the header file into the kernel project,<br />
  And it was modified to include the local header file.<br />
  (Change braket to double quote. ,

</p>
<p>I edited about 5 files.</p>
<h3>
  typedef redefinition with different types ('struct uuid_t' vs
  '__darwin_uuid_t' (aka 'unsigned char[16]'))
</h3>
<pre><code>/* UUID types for backward compatibility, don&#039;t use in new code */
typedef struct {
        __u8 b[16];
} guid_t;

#define uuid_t compat_uuit_t

typedef struct {
        __u8 b[16];
} uuid_t;</code></pre>
<p>
  The file structure of the post I referenced and my computer was a little
  different, and the code included #endif, so I thought, 'Where does the if
  begin?' I thought a lot about it.
</p>
<p>I just did the above and it built without problems.</p>
<p>The key seems to be adding <code>#define uuid_t compat_uuit_t</code>.</p>
<h3>openssl setup issue</h3>
<p>
  Similar to elf.h earlier, my computer could not import the openssl header
  file.<br />
  I was repeating builds and modifications, and correcting errors.<br />
  There was no end, so I stopped the work and looked for how many places needed
  to be corrected.<br />
  About 500+ places needed fixing...
</p>
<p>
  I thought it was not something a person would do, so I made batch changes
  using regex as a command.
</p>
<h3>build success</h3>
<p>After solving these and other issues, a vmlinux file was created.</p>
<p>The build itself seems to have taken about 10 minutes.</p>
