description: 이 포스트에서는 pnpm 기반 프로젝트에서 Firebase Hosting과 GitHub Action을 연결하는 방법을 설명합니다. Firebase CLI는 기본적으로 Hosting과 GitHub Action의 통합을 제공하며, 이 방법을 통해 GitHub 워크플로우 파일이 생성됩니다. pnpm을 사용하여 설치 및 빌드를 진행하려면 워크플로우 파일을 수정해야 하며, 코드를 수정하고 GitHub에 푸시하면 성공적으로 빌드되고 반영되는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다.

<p>
  This post explains how to connect firebase hosting and github action in a pnpm
  based project.
</p>
<p>
  In firebase cli, it provides integration of hosting and github action by
  default.

    >Deploy to live &amp; preview channels via GitHub pull requests</a
  >
</p>
<p>
  When integrating through this method, a github workflow file will be
  created.<br />
  (firebase-hosting-merge.yml, firebase-hosting-pull-request.yml)
</p>
<p>
  The contents are as follows.<br />
  (You only need to look at the jobs part. It is explained based on
  firebase-hosting-merge.yml.)
</p>
<pre><code># This file was auto-generated by the Firebase CLI
# https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools

name: Deploy to Firebase Hosting on merge
&#039;on&#039;:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build_and_deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm ci &amp;&amp; npm run build
      - uses: FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy@v0
        with:
          repoToken: &#039;${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}&#039;
          firebaseServiceAccount: &#039;${{ secrets.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_YOUR_PROJECT_ID }}&#039;
          channelId: live
          projectId: your_project_id</code></pre>
<p>
  In this state, to proceed with install and build through pnpm, modify as
  follows.

          channelId: live
          projectId: your_project_id</code></pre>
<p>
  If you modify the code and push it to github,<br />
  You can see that it is built and reflected successfully.
